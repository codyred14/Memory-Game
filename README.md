# Memory-Game

A classic remake of the memory game. The goal of this game is to match blocks of the same color. Only two blocks are allowed to be flipped at a time so memory is a key factor in completing this game. The player's score is tracked until the game is complete. When the game is complete the player is alerted via message and asked if they would like to play again. If the player chooses to play again the page will be reset.
